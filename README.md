## **Project Overview**

Our project collects payroll data from NYC public employees, allowing users to sort, search, and interact with the data.

## **Features**

Users can sort by first initial, last initial, annual pay, hourly pay, and by borough.
Sorting by borough displays the number of people, highest salary, lowest salary, and the mean income.

## **Technologies Used**

We utilized API data from the NYC Open Data program, the GSAP library for animaitons, and Google Fonts.
